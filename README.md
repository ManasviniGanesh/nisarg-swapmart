<h2>Introduction</h2>
SwapMart is a C2C E Commerce Website. It provides a platform for students, staff and faculties to share, rent, and sell things. It could be anything in between an old toaster to drafter or calculator. It is also useful in sharing notes that are no longer needed. Or maybe even lend a bike for a ride!
