<b>Introduction</b> - 

SwapMart is an E Commerce Website similiar to OLX and Quickr where classifieds are put up by comman man for comman man. But different from them in that - 
SwapMart is aimed for students within <b>campus</b> to share or exchange their items online with ease. Items could be anything in between an old toaster to drafter or calculator. 
Many students cannot affor these expensive items. ANd there are at times unavailablity of access of certain resources like notes of a good teacher or refernce books or bunch of question papers that can be bought online for small price.
It makes life of students easier and less expensive as many of these items are not required more than a semester or a few whereas an engineering course constitues a minimum of 8 semesters.

<b>Features</b> - 

1. <b>VERIFIED USERS</b> - E Mail ID used to register the student is college's mail ID. Every student needs to register using only that. So that verification is made by admins of the site for scrutiny.
2. <b>ANONYMITY</b> - Spams are often common when the identity of the user is revealed online. SwapMart doesnot show the details of the advertiser unless required so less spams better life.
3. <b>E Mails FROM SWAPMART</b> - Automatic e mails are generated only on occasions of creation, deletion and re creating the accounts with swapmart. So less e mails from site as well.
